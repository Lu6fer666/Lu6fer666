<p>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @Lu6fer666.</p>
ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in programming in general, but I'm currently focused on full-stack development.
ðŸŒ± I'm currently interested on various technologies in front-end development, including server-side programming languages like Python and Node.js, as well as frontend frameworks like React and Angular.
ðŸ“« You can reach me by sending a message to my GitHub profile @Lu6fer666. I'm also open to discussions via email at julienmilo369@gmail.com. I'm excited to connect with you and collaborate on exciting projects!
